# opus6_weather_dash

## Description 

As a developer, third-party APIs are often needed to retrieve data to use in their own applications. This project uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a weather dashboard. It runs in the browser and has dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The application features:

* A search area for cities that will produce present and future weather conditions for the city and then the city is added to a search history

* The current weather for the city displays the city name, the date, a weather icon representing the current conditions, the temperature, the humidity, wind speed, and the UV Index

* The UV Index shows whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

* The forecast displays a 5-day forecast, with the date, a weather icon, the temperature, and the humidity

* The search history allows one to click on a city and displays the current and future conditions

    2. When you click on the search button, the city's weather is displayed, and the city is saved to the search history beneath the input area
    3. If you want to go to a previous city, simply click on the city that you wish to have displayed
